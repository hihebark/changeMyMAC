A small script with bash to change you'r mac address. I create this script because of network-manager don't change my mac after restart it.

Usage:
------

`# bash changeMyMAC.sh [-r | -m ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff | -p]`

Random MAC:

`# bash changeMyMAC.sh -r`
Change my MAC to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
 
`# bash changeMyMAC.sh -m ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`

Change to you'r permanent MAC

`# bash changeMyMAC.sh -p`
